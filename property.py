# Example usage:
# Creating a property
# boardwalk = Property(
#     name="Boardwalk",
#     price=400, rent=[50, 200, 600, 1400, 1700, 2000],
#     color_group="Dark Blue", 
#     house_cost=200, 
#     hotel_cost=200
# #     )

# # Buying the property
# boardwalk.buy_property("player")

# # Building houses
# boardwalk.build_house()
# boardwalk.build_house()

# # Calculating rent
# print(boardwalk.calculate_rent())  # Output will vary based on the number of houses/hotels

# # Mortgaging the property
# boardwalk.mortgage_property()

# # Unmortgaging the property
# boardwalk.unmortgage_property()
